# Passphrase Generator

Passphrase Generator uses [diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) lists from multiple languages to generate passphrases for you. A passphrase is a password that consists of an easy to remember sequence of words. Passphrases are generally more secure than regular passwords because they contain more characters.
